# sfs-num-analysis
This repository contains R scripts for numerical analysis of the Wright-Fisher diffusion 
under pretty general conditions of demography and selection in a single population. 
Individual runs can be performed using 

```
Rscript run_solution_single.r 
```

The necessary arguments are described in the comments to run_solution_single.r. All 
time parameters are given in coalescent units according to the initial population 
size.
